## 1. binarylifting1.cpp
  This code produces LCA of a given tree using the concept of binary lifting.
  
## 2. binarylifting2.cpp
  This code produces LCA of a given tree using the concept of binary lifting with the use of Ancestors.

## 3. Two SAT
    
  1. Given an implication graph, this checks if a solution exists.
  addXor(), addAnd(), addOr() can be used to appropriately add clauses.
    
  2. forceTrue() forces some variable to be true.
     forceFalse() forces some variable to be false.

  3. You can also add additional implications yourself.
  
  4. solve() checks if in the final implication graph, a valid solution exists.
  
  5. mark[u] stores the boolean value of the node (u). You can use mark[] to
  recover the final solution as well.

  6. Notes on Indexing Nodes : (i) u = 2k, !u = 2k + 1 (ii) Nodes are 0-indexed. [0, NUM VERTICES)
